# Summary

[TimeStruct](https://github.com/sintefore/TimeStruct.jl) is an interface for abstracting time structures written in Julia [@bezanson2017julia], primarlily intended for use with the mathematical programming DSL JuMP [@Lubin2023].

# Statement of need


# Example application

# Acknowledgements

The development of `TimeStruct` was funded by the Norwegian Research Council in the projects [Clean Export](https://www.sintef.no/en/projects/2020/cleanexport/), project number [308811](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/project/FORISS/308811) and TODO:FILL IN.
