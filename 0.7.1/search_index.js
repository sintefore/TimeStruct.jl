Since investment decisions usually are done on a strategic level, discount  factors are also calculated based on strategic periods. \n\nThe discount factor for a time period t is found by the discount function. There are two strategies for calculating the discount factor, either all discounting is calculated based on the start of the strategic period or it is based on finding an approximation of the average value over the  strategic period. The following example shows how these two types will differ for a planning period of 50 years, consisting of 5 periods of  10 years:\n\nusing TimeStruct\nts = TwoLevel(5, 10, SimpleTimes(1,1));\ndf_start = [discount(t, ts, 0.05; type = \"start\") for t in ts]\ndf_avg = [discount(t, ts, 0.05; type = \"avg\") for t in ts]\n\nWhile it is often normal to assume investments at the start of each  strategic period, it can be more correct to average the discount factor for operational costs that are accrued throughout the strategic period.\n\nTo help setting up the objective function in a typical optimization problem, there is a utility function objective_weight that returns the weight to give a time period in the objective, considering both discount factor, probability and possible multiplicity.
